Your Home's Air Safety Guardian
Protecting Your Home: Introducing AtmosAQ - The Multi-Sensor Home Safety Hub Ô∏è üöÄ 

Did you know carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be deadly? Even small amounts can cause serious health problems, making a reliable CO detector essential for every household.

But what if you could do more than just detect CO?

üåüIntroducing AtmosAQ!üåü 

I'm excited to share my latest project ‚Äì an advanced home safety hub that goes beyond basic CO detection. Here's what AtmosAQ offers:

Multi-Sensor Technology:

CO Sensor (MQ-7): Detects the presence of carbon monoxide, safeguarding you from this silent threat.
AQI Sensor (Winsen ZP07-MP503): Tracks Air Quality Index, informing you about overall air quality in your home.
Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT22): Monitors temperature and humidity levels, helping you maintain a comfortable and healthy environment.
Particulate Matter Sensor (MEMSFrontier MPM30-C6): Detects the presence of airborne particles, providing insights into potential allergens and pollutants.

Enhanced User Experience:

LCD Display: Provides clear and concise readings on all monitored parameters: CO levels, AQI, temperature, humidity, and particulate matter concentration.
Grading LEDs: Uses color-coded LEDs for a quick visual indication of Air Quality ‚Äì green for good, yellow for moderate, and red for unhealthy.
Buzzer: Emits an audible alert for critical situations, ensuring immediate notification of high CO levels or unhealthy air quality.

Built with Affordability and Ease in Mind:

Arduino Nano Microcontroller: Utilizes a cost-effective and widely available platform, making AtmosAQ accessible to a broader audience.

A Big Thank You! üôå 

I'd also like to express my sincere gratitude to [Charu Reedla](https://github.com/CharuReedla) and [Aryan Verma](https://github.com/AriaHito) for their invaluable help with the research phase of this project. Their contributions were instrumental in shaping the direction of AtmosAQ, and I couldn't have gotten this far without their support.
